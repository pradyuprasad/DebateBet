However, the Paris Accord's voluntary nature shows the challenge of binding universal agreements.\n        - On Norway's example, it is conceded that while the carbon tax worked there, it might not translate elsewhere without substantial adjustments.\n        - My arguments focus on the limitations of the evidence provided and the challenges in scaling-up, which are crucial for evaluating the motion's feasibility.\n    </preemptiveDefense>\n    <weighing>\n        - The key points revolve around the effectiveness of evidence and the realism of achieving universal participation.\n        - My challenges on the EU ETS and Norway's example undermine the proposition's basis for claiming guaranteed success.\n        - The critique on the UNFCCC's capacity to achieve universal participation questions the feasibility of the proposed framework.\n        - By highlighting these weaknesses, the opposition's case is less compelling, as the proposed global carbon market's success is not sufficiently substantiated.\n    </weighing>\n</rebuttal>",

By highlighting the serious problems with voluntary participation, the mixed success of cap-and-trade systems, and the superiority of regulatory measures in driving technological advancements, my side effectively demonstrates that the proposition's case lacks solid grounding.  \n\n    Ultimately, while the potential benefits of a global carbon market are acknowledged, we must prioritize a pragmatic approach that will yield genuine results in combating climate change. Thus, I urge the judges to favor the opposition's arguments, as they provide a more realistic and effective pathway toward meaningful climate action. Thank you.  \n</voting>\n</finalSpeech>"
